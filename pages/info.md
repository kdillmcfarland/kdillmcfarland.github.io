Greetings! My name is Kim Dill-McFarland (she/her), and I am a Senior Bioinformatician at the U. of Washington. I work at the intersection of microbiology and computer science, applying computational approaches to biological problems. Using sequencing and other high-throughput techniques, I research how the human immune system responds to disease. I work with a variety of labs at UW and am always game to dive into new data! Please see my [resume][resume] to learn more.

This website is a landing place for my work including current projects, workshops I teach, and a blog with things I've found helpful over the years. You can also find me on
