Greetings! My name is Kim Dill-McFarland (she/her), and I am a Bioinformatics Field Applications Scientist at Oxford Nanopore Technologies. I work at the intersection of biology and computer science, applying computational approaches to biological problems. At ONT, I support researchers across the western U.S. in designing experiments, implementing analysis workflows, and applying ONT sequencing to complex biological questions in infectious disease, microbiology, human omics, and beyond. Please see my [resume][resume] to learn more.

This website is a landing place for my work including current projects, workshops I teach, and a blog with things I've found helpful over the years. You can also find me on
